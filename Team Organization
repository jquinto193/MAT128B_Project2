The project was distributed as follows:
For part (i), we all read the pages 179-180 in Greenbaum and Chartier and Jasmine Quinto found the data base (mnist_all.mat). 
For part (ii), Ryan Joseph and Jiaming Peng both wrote programs in order to read digits from the data base. Jiaming made changes
to that of Ryan's program by making a loop in order to save space in writing out a subplot for every number. 
For part (iii), Ryan Joseph and Jasmine both got the same results when they analyzed the activation function/signoidal 
function in order to verify that the expression was correct.
He also anazlized what happens to the output of the activation function for small vs large values of NET.
For part (iv) and (v), since it was very tedious work and it requires many functions, we all had a part in figuring this part out. 
For part (vi) and (vii), Jose Sanchez was in charge of writing the program for this part. 

In the end, we all made sure that the program ran smoothly and the comments were sufficient.
We used the github GITHUB = jquinto193/MAT128B_Project2 (link: https://github.com/jquinto193/MAT128B_Project2)
